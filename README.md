# MongoDB and CRUD learning project


This is the repository to my small pet project, in which I was learning to handle backend logic with MongoDB (through typegoose), Koa and TypeScript in order to create CRUD of "messages" from potential user. 

The app also contains basic tests for all CRUD operations.
